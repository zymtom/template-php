# template-php

template-php is just a small repo containing libs and filestructures that would most likely want for a new PHP project(or atleast that i would)

these libs are all written and authored by me and still heavily under development. If you want to use them keep in mind that the API might be updated, but it is not likely.

Contains the following:
  - SQL lib
    Manage your SQL db, autogenerate and write secure queries in a small framework. Boilerplate code can be generated in ```SQLdbModelBuilder.php``` and then placed in the ```*.db.class.php```, or write it by hand using the small API demonstrated in ```ssm.db.class.php```
  - RestAPI lib
    A smaller library for quickly making clean and miniscule restapi's with minor validation and returncodes.
